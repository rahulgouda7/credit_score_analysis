# credit_score_analysis
Major Project(B.TECH Final Year)


This project aims to analyze credit risk using logistic regression. The dataset used consists of demographic and financial features of borrowers along with their credit scores. By employing logistic regression, we predict the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan based on these features. This analysis assists in assessing creditworthiness and mitigating financial risks for lending institutions.

Dataset: The dataset contains 10,000 records with features such as age, income, debt-to-income ratio, credit utilization, and credit score. Each record includes a binary label indicating whether the borrower defaulted on a loan.
